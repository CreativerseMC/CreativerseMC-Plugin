# CreativerseMC-Plugin
Minecraft 1.17.1 Java Spigot/Paper Plugin

# Dependencies to run on server
WorldEdit, AsyncWorldEdit, and PlotSquared plugins must be installed. This has only been tested on Paper 1.17.1
On top of that, the plugin needs to be connected to an IPFS node and an Ethereum node. I recommend running a local IPFS node and using [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) for the Ethereum node, both are free and easy to set up.

# Dependencies to build from source:
- [PlotSquared v6](https://github.com/IntellectualSites/PlotSquared)
- [WorldEdit](https://github.com/EngineHub/WorldEdit)
- [Web3J](https://github.com/web3j/web3j)
- org.json
- Spigot API 1.17.1
